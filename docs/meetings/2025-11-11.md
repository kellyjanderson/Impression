# Meeting Notes — 2025-11-11

**Attendees:**
- Senior 3D Software Engineer (TDD)
- Senior UX Engineer (TDD)
- Senior QA Engineer (UX + 3D focus)
- Technical Project Manager
- Marketing Project Manager
- Senior Designer

## Key Observations

1. **Preview/IDE experience** needs reliable interpreter detection and a “works out of the box” story.
2. **Modeling roadmap** must lock the feature order requested by product (VS Code integration → uniform primitives → custom tessellation → robust paths/splines → chamfers/fillets).
3. **Documentation voice** should be friendlier, include contribution/onboarding info, and reiterate inclusion expectations.
4. **Testing discipline**: adopt pytest for unit tests; keep screenshot/STL suites for acceptance.

## Action Items

| Owner | Item |
| --- | --- |
| Tools Eng | Finalize VS Code auto-install flow (`feature/vscode-interpreter`), add cleanup/setup scripts. |
| Modeling Eng | Draft proposal for uniform primitive API + backend selection. |
| QA | Evaluate pytest adoption and define smoke/unit split. |
| UX/Design | Outline webview requirements; refresh README contributions/inclusion voice. |
| PMs | Publish feature pipeline doc; ensure README + docs cross-link to onboarding info. |

## Decisions

- Keep standalone PyVista preview for now; VS Code integration focuses on CLI ergonomics until a WebGL/webview preview is scoped.
- Auto-install should update `~/.impression/env`, append sourcing instructions, and prompt the user to reload VS Code.
- README gains “Contributions” and “Community & Inclusion” sections.
- New helper scripts (`scripts/dev/setup_dev_env.sh`, `scripts/dev/reset_impression_env.sh`) standardized for all developers/testers.

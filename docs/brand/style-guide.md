# Impression Style Guide

## Typography

- Prefer sans-serif fonts in documentation (e.g., Inter, Source Sans) and match preview annotations with `make_text` (currently disabled).
- Primary headers use Impression Blue; secondary annotations can use Impression Orange sparingly.

## Iconography & Shapes

- Favor simple, rounded edges and thin 2.5D overlays.
- Use drafting helpers (lines/arrows) in Impression Blue; highlight measurements or warnings in Impression Orange.

## Motion & Interaction

- Preview interactions should feel responsive; use `--show-edges/--hide-edges` to reduce visual noise.

## Sample Palette Tokens

```python
IMPRESSION_BLUE = "#5A7BFF"
IMPRESSION_ORANGE = "#FF7A18"
```

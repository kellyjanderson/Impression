# Findings & Recommendations — 2025-11-11

## Findings

1. **Installer/IDE gap:** Users hit `PYTHON` conflicts and VS Code lacks context when the CLI isn’t already installed. Auto-install did not set shell state, causing PyVista to fail.
2. **Docs fragmentation:** README lacked clone/install/contribution guidance or inclusion statement. Project plan didn’t highlight the newly agreed feature pipeline.
3. **Testing tooling:** Screenshot/STL suites exist, but no unit-level harness (pytest/unittest). Hard to regression-test modeling helpers.
4. **Feature order & ownership:** Prioritization was implicit (based on conversations) rather than recorded.

## Recommendations

1. **Finish VS Code ergonomics** (auto-install, env detection, future webview preview). Track progress in `feature/vscode-interpreter` and keep PM updated.
2. **Adopt pytest** for new unit tests; wrap existing CLI harnesses as acceptance suites. QA to propose structure before uniform primitive work begins.
3. **Document workflow** via [`docs/feature-pipeline.md`](../feature-pipeline.md) and helper scripts so contributors can bring up/down environments consistently.
4. **Update README voice** with Contributions + Community sections, linking to Getting Started and emphasizing inclusion/respect.
5. **Next planning sync** should confirm uniform primitive requirements + tessellation strategy once VS Code work stabilizes.

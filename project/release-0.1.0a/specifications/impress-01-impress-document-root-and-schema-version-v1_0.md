# Impress Spec 01: .impress Document Root And Schema Version (v1.0)

## Overview

Define the minimal root envelope and schema-version contract for `.impress` files.

## Backlink

- [Architecture: Impress Surface Native File Format Architecture](../architecture/impress-surface-native-file-format-architecture.md)

## Scope

This specification promotes the manifest candidate `.impress Document Root And Schema Version` into a final implementation leaf. It covers the behavior, data ownership, reuse boundary, and verification expectations needed to implement this leaf without returning to the architecture document for hidden decisions.

## Responsibilities

- Functions/methods:
  - document root constructor
  - schema version validator
- Data structures/models:
  - document root
  - schema version
- Dependencies/services:
  - `.impress` persistence module
  - JSON codec
- Returns/outputs/signals:
  - valid root envelope
  - unsupported schema diagnostic
- UI surfaces/components:
  - not applicable
- UI fields/elements:
  - not applicable
- Reusable code plan:
  - Existing code reused as-is: standard JSON/path utilities
  - Additions to existing reusable library/module: future `.impress` module
  - New reusable library/module to create: `.impress` persistence module
- Database queries/tables/migrations:
  - none
- Async/concurrency behavior:
  - none
- Destructive/write behavior:
  - writes or changes only the scoped artifact described by this spec
- Security/privacy-sensitive behavior:
  - none unless explicitly named in this candidate
- Performance-sensitive behavior:
  - bounded to the scoped artifact described by this spec
- Cross-screen reusable behavior:
  - not applicable

## Implementation Boundary

Owner/module:

- candidate `.impress` persistence module

Routes:

- public save/load to root validator

Reuse/extraction decision:

- create `.impress` persistence module

UI field/control inventory:

- not applicable

## Data And Defaults

Chosen defaults / parameters:

- schema version is required and explicit

Data ownership:

- document root owns file-level metadata

## Behavior

The implementation must:

- satisfy every function, data-structure, dependency, and output responsibility listed above
- preserve the architecture boundary named in the backlink
- reject unsupported or ambiguous states with explicit diagnostics rather than silent fallback behavior
- keep mesh data outside canonical authored-surface state unless this spec explicitly names a tessellation, compatibility, or mesh-utility boundary
- expose only the public API surface needed by downstream specs and tests

## Constraints

- The implementation must remain deterministic for equivalent inputs.
- The implementation must keep metadata and stable identity behavior explicit when the leaf touches persisted or reusable surface state.
- The implementation must not introduce hidden mesh execution in authored modeling paths.
- The implementation must not broaden industry interchange, patch-family, or mesh compatibility scope beyond what this leaf names.

## Verification

Test strategy:

- root/schema validation tests

Automated or review verification must prove that the implementation satisfies the manifest responsibilities and that failure modes are explicit. Where this spec touches serialization, verification must include round-trip or refusal coverage. Where this spec touches modeling output, verification must include surface-native output checks and no-hidden-mesh-fallback checks.

## Manifest Assessment

Score:

- Functions/methods: 2 x 2 = 4
- Data structures/models: 2 x 1 = 2
- Dependencies/services: 2 x 1 = 2
- Returns/outputs/signals: 2 x 1 = 2
- Existing reusable code reused as-is: 1 x 0.5 = 0.5
- Adding code to an existing library/module: 1 x 1 = 1
- Creating a new reusable library/module: 1 x 3 = 3
- Destructive/write behavior: 1 x 3 = 3
- Security/privacy-sensitive behavior: 1 x 3 = 3
- Performance-sensitive behavior: 1 x 2 = 2
- UI surfaces/components: 0 x 2 = 0
- UI fields/elements: 0 x 1 = 0
- Database queries/tables/migrations: 0 x 2 = 0
- Async/concurrency behavior: 0 x 3 = 0
- Cross-screen reusable behavior: 0 x 2 = 0
- Readiness blockers: 0 x 2 = 0
- Total: 22.5

Split decision:

- Review for split. Cohesion reason: root and schema version are one file-envelope contract.

Open questions / nuance resolved for implementation:

- Units are split out because they are a policy decision, not just envelope shape.

## Refinement Status

Final.

## Child Specifications

None. Final leaf.

## Acceptance

This specification is complete when:

- all manifest responsibilities are implemented or explicitly refused by the leaf
- owner/module, routes, data ownership, reuse, UI inventory, defaults, and test strategy are represented in code or verification artifacts
- related progression items can be checked without relying on unstated architecture assumptions
- downstream specs can cite this leaf instead of re-reading the manifest candidate
